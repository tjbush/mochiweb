THIS PROJECT HAS MOVED! See http://github.com/mochi/mochiweb

MochiWeb is an Erlang library for building lightweight HTTP servers.

It is used (in conjunction with [eswf](http://code.google.com/p/eswf/) and [egeoip](http://code.google.com/p/egeoip)) to power services such as MochiBot and MochiAds, which serve dynamically generated SWF content to millions of viewers daily.
